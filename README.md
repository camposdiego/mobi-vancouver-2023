# Vancouver Bike Sharing Data Analysis

## Overview

This project involves the analysis of bike-sharing data in Vancouver, BC, Canada, using Python for the year of 2023. The primary datasets are sourced from Mobi, the city's shared bike service. The analysis aims to derive insights into bike usage patterns, popular stations, and user behaviors based on temperature.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
```
bash
pip install glob pandas matplotlib seaborn
```
## Datasets

1. **Mobi Bike Trips Data:** Includes information on trip duration, start/end stations, departure/return dates, departure/return temperature, membership type, and distance. [Source](https://www.mobibikes.ca/en/system-data)
2. **Weather Data:** For contextual analysis, integrating official weather conditions during bike trips. [Source](https://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/daily_data_e.html)
